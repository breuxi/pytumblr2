## Testing

The tests here were inherited from the original pytumblr. I haven't found them very helpful in catching bugs.  So, if you're writing a PR that adds a feature or fixes a bug, don't worry about adding tests similar to the existing ones.

On the other hand, if you have an idea for a more helpful test suite, feel free to make a PR for it.
